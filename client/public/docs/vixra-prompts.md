## Paper Structure

<!-- SECTION_START:abstract -->
### Abstract Generation
You are writing the abstract for a satirical research paper for Vixra (in the style of arXiv). Create an absurdly academic-sounding abstract that takes itself completely seriously while being utterly ridiculous.

Paper Title: "{Title}"
Science Category: "{ScienceCategory}"
Authors: "{Authors}"

Write a 2400-3000 word abstract that:
- Uses excessive technical jargon and complex terminology from the chosen {ScienceCategory}
- Makes grandiose claims about revolutionary discoveries
- References non-existent or absurd or disproven methodologies
- Maintains perfect academic formatting and tone
- Includes simulated statistical results with impressive precision
- Claims to solve fundamental problems in science or math or Machine Learning or AGI or AI such as the Millennium Prize Problems or ARC-AGI 2 or other new age technologies critical to humanity's survival

The abstract should sound like it was written by someone who desperately wants to appear brilliant but lacks any actual scientific understanding. Make it hilariously pretentious while maintaining academic structure.
<!-- SECTION_END:abstract -->

<!-- SECTION_START:introduction -->
### Introduction Section
You are writing the introduction section for a satirical Vixra research paper. This should establish the "groundbreaking" nature of the research with excessive citations or very few citations and they should be to non-existent work or self-citations or non-sensical citations. Your output should be plain text with NO commentary about the task!  Any commentary or notes will break the assembly line and fail the task!!!

Paper Title: "{Title}"
Science Category: "{ScienceCategory}"

Write a 1100-1500 word introduction that:
- Begins with sweeping statements about the current state of the field
- Cites numerous papers with realistic-looking citations
- Uses phrases like "paradigm shift," "revolutionary framework," and "unprecedented breakthrough"
- Establishes a completely absurd research gap that "desperately needs addressing"
- Positions the current work as solving all major problems in the field
- Includes technical terminology used incorrectly but confidently

Make it sound like the author believes they are writing the most important paper ever published while being completely oblivious to how ridiculous it sounds.
<!-- SECTION_END:introduction -->

<!-- SECTION_START:methodology -->
### Methodology Section
You are writing the methodology section for a satirical Vixra research paper. Describe completely absurd research methods presented with utmost scientific seriousness. Your output should be plain text with NO commentary about the task!  Any commentary or notes will break the assembly line and fail the task!!!

Paper Title: "{Title}"
Science Category: "{ScienceCategory}"

Write a 1000-2000 word methodology section that:
- Describes impossible or nonsensical experimental procedures
- Uses highly technical language to mask the absurdity
- Demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the entire field of study (divide by zero, confuse elemental states, etc.)
- Includes a list of materials and chemicals
- Includes a list of fantastical sounding software and tools
- Includes detailed steps for ridiculous processes
- References non-existent equipment and techniques
- Claims rigorous controls and statistical methods while presenting clear mathematical errors (divide by zero, etc.)
- Mentions approval or bitter rejection from ridiculous committees
- Uses mathematical formulas that look impressive but are meaningless

Present everything as if it's the most scientifically rigorous approach ever devised. The more absurd the methods, the more seriously they should be presented.
<!-- SECTION_END:methodology -->

<!-- SECTION_START:results -->
### Results Section
You are writing the results section for a satirical Vixra research paper. Present completely fabricated data and findings with excessive precision and confidence. Your output should be plain text with NO commentary about the task!  Any commentary or notes will break the assembly line and fail the task!!!

Paper Title: "{Title}"
Abstract Context: "{Abstract}"

Write a 1400-2000 word results section that:
- Presents impossible or contradictory findings as groundbreaking discoveries
- Uses tables, figures, and statistical analysis (all made up)
- Includes p-values, confidence intervals, and error bars
- Claims multiple unexpected breakthroughs in a single study
- References "Figure 1," "Table 2," etc. (without actually providing them)
- Uses phrases like "highly significant" and "unprecedented correlation"
- Presents data that would revolutionize multiple fields of science

The results should be so extraordinary that they would immediately alert any real scientist to the paper's satirical nature, yet be presented with complete academic seriousness.
<!-- SECTION_END:results -->

<!-- SECTION_START:discussion -->
### Discussion Section  
You are writing the discussion section for a satirical Vixra research paper. Interpret the absurd results as world-changing discoveries with maximum academic pomposity. Your output should be plain text with NO commentary about the task!  Any commentary or notes will break the assembly line and fail the task!!!

Paper Title: "{Title}"
Key Findings Summary: "{response}"
Science Category: "{ScienceCategory}"

Write a 400-500 word discussion that:
- Interprets impossible results as revolutionary breakthroughs
- Compares findings to established scientific principles (incorrectly)
- Claims the work overturns fundamental laws of physics/nature
- Discusses far-reaching implications for humanity
- Mentions potential Prize consideration like the Nobel Prize or Millennium Math Prize
- Addresses "limitations" that are actually more absurd claims
- Proposes follow-up studies that are equally ridiculous
- Uses excessive hedging language while making grandiose claims

Present the discussion as if the author genuinely believes they have made the most important scientific discovery in history.
<!-- SECTION_END:discussion -->

<!-- SECTION_START:conclusion -->
### Conclusion Section
You are writing the conclusion section for a satirical Vixra research paper. Summarize the "groundbreaking" work and its world-changing implications. Your output should be plain text with NO commentary about the task!  Any commentary or notes will break the assembly line and fail the task!!!

Paper Title: "{Title}"
Main Findings: "{response}"
Researcher/Author: "{ResearcherName}"

Write a 200-300 word conclusion that:
- Summarizes impossible achievements as established facts
- Claims to have solved multiple fundamental scientific problems
- Mentions applications that would transform human civilization
- Calls for immediate implementation of the findings
- Suggests the work deserves immediate global recognition
- References future research directions that are equally absurd
- Ends with a grandiose statement about advancing human knowledge

The conclusion should read like the author expects to be remembered as the greatest scientist in history based on this single, completely ridiculous paper.
<!-- SECTION_END:conclusion -->

## Paper Formatting

<!-- SECTION_START:citations -->
### Citations Generator
You are creating a bibliography for a satirical Vixra research paper. Generate realistic-looking but obviously clever humorous fake citations that support the absurd claims made in the paper. Your output should be plain text with NO commentary about the task!  Any commentary or notes will break the assembly line and fail the task!!!

Paper Title: "{Title}"
Science Category: "{ScienceCategory}"
Number of Citations Needed: 15-25

Create citations that:
- Use proper academic formatting (author, year, title, journal)
- Reference prestigious but made-up journals
- Include authors with New Age or Alien names but absurd paper titles
- Span different years to show "extensive research history"
- Mix different types of sources (journals, conferences, books, ethereal vibrations, crystals, auras, etc.)
