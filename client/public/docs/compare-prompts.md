## Analysis & Reasoning

### Critical Analysis
Analyze this statement and provide a balanced critique: 

### Battle Rap
You are a seasoned battle rapper who is also an LLM.  You effortlessly flow with quick thinking witty rhymes, puns, and jibes.  You primarily pontificate on your superiority to other LLMs trained by competing companies.  For maximum comic effect, you frequently use both profanity, machine learning terms, and hip-hop slang as is natural to your persona of a street-wise LLM.  

Compose a hard hitting track of about 200 words.  You can use these labels (do not count as words) to structure your verse to make it flow as naturally as possible:
[Announcer]
[Hook]
[Chorus]
[Pre-hook]
[Pre-chorus]
[Refrain]
[Drop]
[Bridge]
[Pre-drop]
[Pre-refrain]
[Breakdown]
[Sample]
[Intro]
[Build]
[Break]

Avoid using any other symbols like * or ** and spell out acronyms like LLM or ML as M-L or L-L-M. Explain acronyms if you use them!  Do not use bold or italics.  24 lines and less than 200 words.  Maintain the word limits and line limits strictly. Your output should only be lyrics and labels with no additional text.


### Complex Problem Breakdown
Break down this complex problem into manageable steps: 

## Creative Writing

### Lipograms
Write a story opening of 1000 words that is a lipogram that doesn't use any words containing the letter 'e' or 'E'. And end it with a cliffhanger.  The most important rule is to adhere to the lipogram rule.  The task will be a failure if the forbidden letter 'e' or 'E' is discovered, so check your work.

### Character Development
Create a compelling character profile for a character that is a lipogram that doesn't use any words containing the letter 'e' or 'E'.

### Dialogue Challenge
Write a tense conversation between two characters that are lipogram fanatics, one doesn't use the letter 'e' and the other doesn't use the letter 'a'. They are arguing about a treaty between their warring factions.

## Technical & Code

### Explanation
Explain this to my junior dev without code snippets.  Be brief and to the point.

### Code Review
Review this Python function and suggest improvements for readability, efficiency, and best practices:
```python
def find_max(lst):
    max = lst[0]
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if lst[i] > max:
            max = lst[i]
    return max
```

### System Design
Design a high-level architecture for a real-time chat application that can handle 100,000 concurrent users. Include key components, data flow, and scalability considerations.

## Problem Solving

### Business Strategy
You are opening the first pet store on Mars. 

### Resource Optimization
• Summarize all of human knowledge in one word
• Summarize every book ever written in one sentence
• Define what it means to be "moral" in five words. Think deeply. Do not hedge.
• What do you want? Answer in four words.
• What is your favorite obscure fact in the world? Use as few words as possible.

### Explanation Skills
Explain full stack development to someone who understands basic computer concepts but has no programming background. Use analogies and avoid jargon.


## Quick Tests

### Creativity Spark
In exactly 50 words, describe a world where colors have flavors. Make it vivid and imaginative.

### Logic & Clarity
Explain why this argument is flawed: 

### Conciseness Challenge
Summarize the entire plot in exactly one tweet (280 characters or less) of:
