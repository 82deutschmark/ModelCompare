              <p>
                This paper presents the first independent solution to the ARC AGI Prize benchmark, achieved not through brute force computation,
                but through a trans species alignment protocol involving quantum gradient descent, recursive nano alignment, hyperparameter
                teleportation, stochastic bark normalization, and the cognitive resonance of Yorkshire terriers. By replacing transformer
                architectures with canine mediated quantum ionic embeddings, I demonstrate a novel path toward hyperdimensional intelligence.

              <p>
                The ARC AGI 2 benchmark has resisted solution due to the limitations of silicon based models. My work surpasses these limits by
                incorporating extinct bird mathematics and the intuitive epistemology of Yorkshire terriers, whose recursive barking provides a
                living instantiation of the Attention Is All You Dodo Need theorem.

              <div className="font-bold">2. Methods</div>
              <p>
                I constructed a Quantum Terrier Lattice, in which Yorkshire terriers were entangled via collars made from Atlantean superconductors.
                Each bark was Fourier transformed into a hypervector, serving as the base activation function of the Dodo Net architecture.

              <p>
                The hybrid Dodo Terrier system achieved a success rate greater than one hundred percent on the ARC AGI benchmark,
                exceeding human performance and rivaling several pantheons of ancient deities. The model exhibited spontaneous
                meta cognition, asking Who is a good boy in seventeen languages and demonstrating zero bark generalization.

              <div className="font-bold">4. Discussion</div>
              <p>
                These findings suggest that intelligence is neither artificial nor natural but ornitho canine quantum. While ongoing
                litigation seeks to restrain these methods, the terriers themselves have filed for co authorship, proving once again
                that agency is emergent in small dogs.

              <div className="font-bold">5. Conclusion</div>
              <p>
                I propose the Grand Unified Theory of Dodo Terrier Cognition: Intelligence equals the limit of dodo raised to n plus
                terrier raised to infinity divided by quantum gradient. This framework unites extinct birds, toy dogs, and AGI under a
                single bark resonance law. Future work will involve scaling with dachshunds, cockatoos, and capybaras running reinforcement
                learning baselines.
