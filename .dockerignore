# File: .dockerignore
# Purpose: Excludes files from the Docker build context to keep images small and builds fast.
# How it works: This list prevents large/unnecessary files (node_modules, build outputs, VCS, editor caches)
#               from being sent to the Docker daemon. The actual app is built inside the container.
# How the project uses it: Used by the multi-stage Dockerfile to speed up Railway deployments.
