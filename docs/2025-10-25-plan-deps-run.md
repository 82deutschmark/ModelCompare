## Goal
Ensure the ModelCompare workspace installs all Node dependencies cleanly and confirm the development server starts without runtime errors.

## Current Context
- Fresh workspace sync with potential unmet dependencies.
- No prior verification that `npm install` completes on Windows PowerShell.
- Need to respect hobby-scale constraints while keeping production-ready discipline.

## Plan of Action
1. **Dependency Installation**
   - Run `npm install` from the repository root to hydrate `node_modules`.
   - Watch for peer dependency conflicts or postinstall script failures.
2. **Environment Sanity Check**
   - Validate critical env vars exist (`.env` already managed per project rules).
   - Confirm no additional setup (database migrations) is required pre-run.
3. **Runtime Verification**
   - Launch `npm run dev` to ensure both backend (Express) and frontend (Vite) bootstrap successfully.
   - Observe logs for binding errors, missing envs, or TypeScript compilation issues.
4. **Post-Run Notes**
   - Capture any follow-up actions (e.g., needed migrations, failing subsystems).

## Success Criteria
- `npm install` exits with code 0.
- `npm run dev` starts both servers and remains stable for observation period.
- Document any blockers preventing full startup.
