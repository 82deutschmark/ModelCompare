# Mark the Manager Agent - Best Practices Upgrade

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Agent:** Mark the Manager (`mark.ts`)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive upgrade implementing AgentDefinition best practices
**Status:** Implementation In Progress

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines 12 improvements to Mark the Manager agent based on deep analysis of `agent-definition.ts` best practices. The improvements are prioritized by impact and organized into 5 implementation phases.

**Critical Finding:** Mark uses `outputMode: 'structured_output'` but lacks an `outputSchema` definition, making output unpredictable and not machine-readable.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. CRITICAL: Missing outputSchema ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current State:**
```typescript
outputMode: 'structured_output',
// ‚ùå NO outputSchema defined!
```

**Problem:**
- Structured output mode requires explicit schema
- Without schema, output format is unpredictable
- Downstream systems can't parse results reliably
- Violates TypeScript principle of explicit contracts

**Solution:**
Define comprehensive schema with:
- Executive summary
- Complexity and risk scoring
- Execution plan with steps
- Engineering quality metrics
- Success criteria and testing strategy
- Dependencies and risks
- Next steps for user

**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Core functionality affected

---

### 2. CRITICAL: Missing 'think_deeply' Tool

**Current State:**
```typescript
toolNames: [
  'spawn_agents',
  'set_output',
  'add_message',
  'end_turn',
  'mcp_list_tools',
  'mcp_call_tool'
  // ‚ùå NO 'think_deeply'!
]
```

**Problem:**
- Mark is a MANAGER who needs deep thinking capability
- Currently can only spawn thinker agents (adds latency)
- Can't do quick analysis without external agents
- Type definition shows 'think_deeply' is available

**Solution:**
Add `'think_deeply'` to toolNames array

**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Core capability missing

---

### 3. CRITICAL: Agent Reference Mismatch

**Current State:**
```typescript
systemPrompt: `...
- simple-researcher: Basic web/docs research  // ‚ùå Not in spawnableAgents!
- code-assistant: Code analysis and editing   // ‚ùå Not in spawnableAgents!
`
```

**Problem:**
- Documentation references agents that can't be spawned
- Misleading to Mark and confusing for debugging
- Creates false expectations

**Solution:**
- Remove references to unavailable agents
- Document only spawnable agents
- Organize agents by category with comments

**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Documentation accuracy

---

### 4. HIGH VALUE: No handleSteps Function

**Current State:**
No `handleSteps` function defined - relies entirely on LLM orchestration

**Problem:**
- Workflow is non-deterministic
- Can't guarantee execution order
- No programmatic quality gates
- Harder to debug and test
- Misses powerful orchestration capability

**Solution:**
Implement generator function with:
1. Initial deep thinking phase
2. Parallel research and critical analysis (file-explorer + Benny)
3. Model processing step
4. Engineering pre-check (Edgar)
5. Final plan synthesis (STEP_ALL)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Deterministic workflow
- ‚úÖ Parallel agent spawning
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed quality checks
- ‚úÖ Better logging and debugging
- ‚úÖ Enforced best practices

**Impact:** üü° **HIGH** - Significant capability enhancement

---

### 5. HIGH VALUE: Limited File Operation Tools

**Current State:**
Mark can't read files, search code, or discover patterns independently

**Problem:**
- Must spawn agents for every file read
- Adds latency and complexity
- Can't quickly verify facts
- Inefficient for simple lookups

**Solution:**
Add to toolNames:
- `'read_files'` - Read CLAUDE.md, docs, plans
- `'find_files'` - Discover related files
- `'code_search'` - Search for patterns

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Self-service research capability
- ‚úÖ Reduced agent spawning overhead
- ‚úÖ Faster fact verification
- ‚úÖ Better context awareness

**Impact:** üü° **HIGH** - Significant efficiency gain

---

### 6. HIGH VALUE: Underpowered Input Schema

**Current State:**
```typescript
inputSchema: {
  prompt: {
    type: 'string',
    description: 'What crazy new feature do you want to add!? üòÅ'
  }
  // ‚ùå No params object!
}
```

**Problem:**
- Can only accept freeform text
- No structured metadata capture
- Can't pre-categorize requests
- Misses opportunity for smart routing

**Solution:**
Add params object with:
- `priority`: low/medium/high/critical
- `complexity`: simple/moderate/complex/unknown
- `affectedSystems`: array of impacted components
- `hasExistingCode`: boolean
- `timeframe`: target completion
- `constraints`: special requirements

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Structured request metadata
- ‚úÖ Better prioritization
- ‚úÖ Smarter agent routing
- ‚úÖ Improved analytics

**Impact:** üü° **HIGH** - Better input processing

---

### 7. QUALITY: No stepPrompt Defined

**Current State:**
Only `systemPrompt` and `instructionsPrompt` defined

**Opportunity:**
`stepPrompt` is inserted at EVERY agent step - perfect for reinforcing critical checks

**Solution:**
Add stepPrompt with checklist:
```
Before each action:
1. Have I gathered enough information?
2. Have I considered Benny's concerns?
3. Have I validated with Edgar?
4. Is this the simplest approach?
5. Am I documenting decisions?
```

**Impact:** üü¢ **MEDIUM** - Behavior reinforcement

---

### 8. QUALITY: Unorganized Spawnable Agents

**Current State:**
Flat list of 13+ agents with no categorization

**Problem:**
- Hard to scan and understand capabilities
- No clear purpose documentation
- Difficult to maintain

**Solution:**
Organize with category comments:
- Research & Discovery (3 agents)
- Analysis & Planning (4 agents)
- Quality & Review (3 agents)
- Execution & DevOps (3 agents)

**Impact:** üü¢ **LOW** - Documentation quality

---

### 9. QUALITY: No Complexity Assessment Framework

**Current State:**
No objective criteria for judging complexity

**Problem:**
- Subjective assessments
- Inconsistent handling
- Poor resource allocation

**Solution:**
Add to systemPrompt:
```
COMPLEXITY SCORING (1-10):
1-3: Simple (single file, clear requirements, no dependencies)
4-6: Moderate (multiple files, some unknowns, manageable dependencies)
7-9: Complex (cross-system changes, architectural decisions, high risk)
10: Critical (major refactor, breaking changes, extensive testing needed)
```

**Impact:** üü¢ **MEDIUM** - Better assessment quality

---

### 10. QUALITY: No Pre-Flight Validation

**Current State:**
Mark proceeds immediately without validation checklist

**Problem:**
- May work with incomplete information
- Doesn't verify prerequisites
- No systematic requirement gathering

**Solution:**
Add pre-flight checklist to instructions:
```
PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST:
‚ñ° Requirements are clear and unambiguous
‚ñ° Success criteria are defined
‚ñ° Affected systems are identified
‚ñ° Dependencies are understood
‚ñ° Resources are available
‚ñ° User has been asked clarifying questions

If ANY fails: Request more information before proceeding.
```

**Impact:** üü¢ **MEDIUM** - Quality gate

---

### 11. QUALITY: Limited MCP Server Guidance

**Current State:**
Generic mention of MCP servers without specific use cases

**Problem:**
- Underutilized powerful tools
- Unclear when to use which server

**Solution:**
Add specific guidance:
```
USE chlorpromazine WHEN:
- Need current MCP specifications
- Looking for MCP implementation patterns
- Validating MCP server configurations

USE exa WHEN:
- Researching similar projects
- Finding industry best practices
- Discovering new approaches
```

**Impact:** üü¢ **LOW** - Tool utilization

---

### 12. QUALITY: No Progress Tracking Strategy

**Current State:**
`add_message` tool available but no guidance on progress tracking

**Opportunity:**
Use `add_message` to create milestone markers

**Solution:**
Add to instructions:
```
Use add_message to log progress milestones:
- "‚úÖ Research complete"
- "üîÑ Edgar reviewing"
- "‚ö†Ô∏è Issues found, addressing..."
- "‚ú® Plan ready for review"
```

**Impact:** üü¢ **LOW** - Visibility improvement
