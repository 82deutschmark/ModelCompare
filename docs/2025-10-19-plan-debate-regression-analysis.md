PURPOSE: Document investigation plan and goals for identifying regression on the debate page introduced by recent commits, ensuring SRP and DRY adherence while leveraging existing architecture.
SRP/DRY check: Pass

## Objective

Determine the root cause of the regression affecting the debate page and outline remediation steps without introducing new architectural debt.

## Current Understanding

- Regression surfaced after recent debate-related commits.
- Debate feature spans server routes, hooks, components, and provider logic.

## Investigation Plan

1. Review recent commits (`git log`, PR notes) focusing on debate functionality to understand scope of changes.
2. Inspect modified debate client hooks/components and corresponding server routes for potential breaking changes.
3. Reproduce the regression locally, collect console/network errors, and trace to offending code.

## Success Criteria

- Regression reproduced and root cause identified with file and line references.
- Recommended fix documented with SRP/DRY-compliant approach.
- CHANGELOG updated after remediation (pending actual fix).
