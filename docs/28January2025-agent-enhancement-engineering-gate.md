# Agent Enhancement: Engineering Gate Implementation

**Date**: January 28, 2025
**Author**: Claude Code using Sonnet 4
**Purpose**: Enhanced Mark (mark.ts) and Edgar (edgar-the-engineer.ts) agents with integrated quality control workflow

## SRP/DRY Check: Pass
- Edgar maintains single responsibility: code quality analysis
- Mark maintains single responsibility: project coordination with added quality gate
- No duplication of existing functionality
- Structured output schema provides reusable contract

## shadcn/ui Check: Pass
- Edgar now explicitly validates shadcn/ui usage
- Flags custom components where shadcn/ui alternatives exist
- No custom UI written - agents are backend logic only

## Architecture Decisions

### Engineering Gate Pattern
Implemented mandatory quality control workflow:
1. **Mark coordinates** → spawns Edgar for analysis
2. **Quality Gate** → blocks commits on HIGH severity issues
3. **Fix Loop** → spawns editor/code-assistant for remediation
4. **Requirements Check** → commit-reviewer validates against specs
5. **Documentation** → ensures architectural decisions are recorded

### Structured Output Contract
Edgar now emits machine-readable JSON:
```typescript
{
  filesAnalyzed: string[],
  findings: Array<{
    principle: 'SRP'|'DRY'|'Over'|'Under'|'shadcn',
    file: string,
    severity: 'LOW'|'MEDIUM'|'HIGH',
    message: string,
    fixIt: string
  }>,
  scores: { srp: number, dry: number, balance: number },
  priorityFixes: Array<{ file, change, rationale }>
}
```

### Diff-Scoped Analysis
Edgar automatically focuses on changed files via `git diff --name-only` when no explicit paths provided, improving efficiency and relevance.

## Key Enhancements

### Mark (Coordinator)
- **Tools Added**: `set_output`, `add_message`, `end_turn` for orchestration
- **Agents Added**: `edgar-the-engineer`, `commit-reviewer`, `basic-diff-reviewer`
- **Engineering Gate**: Mandatory quality checks before any code commits
- **Documentation Enforcement**: Ensures /docs/{date}-{plan}-{goal}.md maintenance

### Edgar (Engineer)
- **Output Mode**: Switched to `structured_output` with comprehensive schema
- **Tools Added**: `run_terminal_command` for git operations
- **Diff Scoping**: Automatic analysis of recent changes
- **shadcn/ui Validation**: Explicit checks for UI component compliance
- **Priority Focus**: Limited to top 5 actionable issues

## Benefits

1. **Automated Quality Control**: HIGH severity issues block commits automatically
2. **Machine-Readable Results**: Structured output enables programmatic responses
3. **Focused Analysis**: Diff scoping targets relevant changes
4. **UI Consistency**: shadcn/ui compliance enforced
5. **Documentation Hygiene**: Architectural decisions captured systematically

## Technical Debt

- None identified - clean implementation following existing patterns
- Both agents maintain backward compatibility
- Integration follows established agent spawning conventions

## Next Steps

1. Test the Engineering Gate workflow with actual code changes
2. Monitor Edgar's structured output for tuning needs
3. Consider Phase 2 enhancements (hotspot analysis, dependency diagrams)
4. Validate shadcn/ui detection accuracy with real components

## Integration Points

- Mark orchestrates the complete quality workflow
- Edgar provides actionable, machine-readable feedback
- Standard agents (editor, commit-reviewer) handle remediation
- Documentation system captures decisions automatically

This implementation creates a robust, automated quality assurance system while maintaining the lightweight, hobby-project appropriate scale.
