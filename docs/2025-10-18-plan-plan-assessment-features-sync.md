PURPOSE: Outline tasks required to reconcile the plan assessment work with
         updates on the features branch and document validation steps.
SRP/DRY check: Pass - Documentation only, references implementation files
               without duplicating logic.

# Plan: Sync Plan Assessment Work with `features`

## Goals
- Rebase or merge the plan assessment refresh onto the latest `features` branch state.
- Ensure default model IDs are shared via a single source to prevent merge conflicts.
- Confirm colorful hero styling coexists cleanly with upstream layout refinements.

## Tasks
1. Pull the `features` branch and review overlapping edits to plan assessment files.
2. Extract shared constants (default model trio) into a small config module for reuse.
3. Reconcile UI structure differences by aligning with upstream component patterns.
4. Run `npm run check` to verify the merged result type-checks before opening a PR.

## Risks & Notes
- Upstream edits may have renamed model IDs; keep constants in sync with catalog.
- Watch for duplicated toast logic when merging; retain a single validation path.
- Gradient layers should preserve accessibility contrast after merging styles.
