# Agents SDK Greenfield Build – Phase Alpha (2025-10-25)

## Context
- Goal: Stand up a brand-new OpenAI Agents SDK implementation under `agents-sdk/`, using Luigi narrative content as reference only.
- Scope today: establish shared tooling, orchestrator scaffolding, and documentation for the new pipeline.

## Completed Today
1. **Strategy Pivot**
   - Captured the greenfield direction in this status log so downstream work aligns with the new `agents-sdk/` workspace.
   - Archived prior migration assumptions; no legacy code paths will be modified going forward.
2. **Architecture Outline**
   - Defined top-level package layout: `agents-sdk/shared`, `agents-sdk/orchestrator`, `agents-sdk/stages`, `agents-sdk/tasks`.
   - Confirmed requirement to recreate instructions/content from Luigi agents while re-implementing all logic fresh.

## In Progress / Upcoming
1. **Shared SDK Utilities**
   - Implement `readRepositoryFilesTool`, `createHandoff`, and thinker delegate wrappers scoped to the new folder.
2. **Master Orchestrator (Greenfield)**
   - Author new orchestrator agent referencing stage leads via handoffs; ensure instructions reflect the fresh feature rollout.
3. **Stage Lead Templates**
   - Draft reusable schema and instruction templates for the first stage lead batch (Analysis) to validate the pattern.
4. **Documentation & Tooling Alignment**
   - Update build tooling (`tsconfig.json`, lint rules) to include the `agents-sdk/` directory.
   - Prepare CHANGELOG entry once initial module skeleton lands.

## Blockers / Risks
- **Tool Access**: need confirmation on file-system access boundaries for the new `readRepositoryFilesTool` (reuse existing security helpers or re-specify?).
- **Thinker Delegation**: unclear whether thinker agents remain external references or should be reauthored; tracked as open design question.
- **Testing Workflow**: establish how we’ll validate orchestrator + stage interactions before integrating with any runner.

## Next Actions
1. Create `agents-sdk/` directory with shared tooling module and export surface.
2. Implement the master orchestrator using the new helpers.
3. Scaffold Analysis stage lead and its child tasks as pure SDK agents.
4. Run `npm run check` once the initial batch compiles; capture findings in the changelog.
