# Plan: Update Changelog for Google OAuth Callback Fix

## Goal
Document the Google OAuth callback resolver fix in `CHANGELOG.md` so deployments reflect the remediation history.

## Tasks
1. Review recent Google OAuth resolver changes to summarize impact accurately.
2. Update the `[Unreleased]` section of the changelog with a `Fixed` entry describing the callback configuration correction for production and staging.
3. Ensure changelog header metadata aligns with repository comment requirements.
4. Run formatting or lint checks if required (not anticipated for documentation-only update).
5. Stage changes, commit with descriptive message, and prepare PR summary.

## Validation
- Confirm changelog entry clearly references production and staging callback correction.
- Verify no conflicting instructions exist for touched files.
- Ensure git status is clean after commit.
