# 2025-10-17-Claude-Haiku-4-5-Integration-Plan

* Author: GPT-5 Codex
* Date: 2025-10-17 and the 19:05 UTC
* PURPOSE: Define the precise updates required to surface Claude Haiku 4.5 across shared model metadata, provider limits, and release notes, while mapping any cascading touchpoints that could duplicate existing Anthropic logic.
* SRP/DRY check: Pass - Focused planning artifact dedicated to this integration; confirmed no prior Claude Haiku 4.5 plan exists.

## Goal
Expose Claude Haiku 4.5 through direct Anthropic and OpenRouter entries, ensure token ceilings align with Anthropic limits, and document the addition for downstream consumers.

## Tasks
1. Examine `shared/model-catalog.ts` and Anthropic provider logic (`server/providers/anthropic.ts`) to verify insertion points and existing max-token handling.
2. Add Claude Haiku 4.5 entries for both direct Anthropic and OpenRouter catalogs with accurate metadata (context window, pricing, reasoning flag).
3. Update provider max-token selection to enforce the 16k generation cap for Haiku 4.5 and capture the change in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Misaligned token ceilings causing truncated completions.  
  **Mitigation:** Mirror Anthropic's documented 16k generation limit and ensure fallback logic respects it.
- **Risk:** UI grouping drift when inserting new OpenRouter models.  
  **Mitigation:** Place new entry after Grok group but before NVIDIA to match existing sequencing guidance.

## Validation
- Run targeted TypeScript type check (`npm run check`) if time permits; otherwise manually verify no TypeScript errors are introduced due to data structure violations.
- Manually inspect UI grouping in a future session to ensure the new entries render with expected thematic color and provider labels.
