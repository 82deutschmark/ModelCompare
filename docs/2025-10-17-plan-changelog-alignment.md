# Plan â€” Changelog Alignment (2025-10-17)

## Goal
Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` accurately captures all Oct 17 releases with proper semantic versioning and scope notes after recent merge conflicts and fixes.

## Tasks
1. Review recent commits on Oct 17 to identify release-worthy changes (jury gating, debate session recovery, previous additions).
2. Consolidate duplicate `0.4.7` and `0.4.6` sections while preserving content under correct headings.
3. Add a new `0.4.8` entry reflecting the debate streaming session repair and jury gating work.
4. Verify formatting, ordering (newest first), and semver semantics before staging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Changelog top entry reads `Version 0.4.8 - 2025-10-17` with accurate bullet points.
- Only one section exists for each 0.4.x version.
- File retains standardized header comment and markdown structure.
