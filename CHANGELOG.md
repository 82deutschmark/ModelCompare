  - **StreamingDisplay Component:** Real-time rendering of AI reasoning and content as they stream in, with progress indicators and error handling
  - **StreamingControls Component:** Comprehensive playback controls (start, pause, resume, cancel, restart) with visual feedback and status indicators
  - **useAdvancedStreaming Hook:** Proper Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation using EventSource instead of manual fetch parsing
  - **Enhanced Debate Session Management:** Database integration for creating, saving, and resuming debate sessions with proper conversation chaining
  - **Model-Specific Configuration:** Each model can have independent settings optimized for debate performance

### Technical Details
- **Proper SSE Implementation:** Replaced manual fetch-based streaming with EventSource for reliable real-time updates
- **Database Session Persistence:** Debates are now saved to database with turn history and response ID tracking for conversation chaining
- **Advanced Reasoning Controls:** Full implementation of OpenAI Responses API reasoning configuration (effort, summary, verbosity)
- **Real-Time UI Updates:** Live progress bars, cost estimation, and streaming content display during debates
- **Conversation Chaining:** Proper handling of model conversation history with database-stored response IDs

### Notes
- **DRY Violations Identified:** Current debate.tsx implementation contains significant code duplication and SRP violations that should be addressed in future refactoring
- **Session Management:** Complete database integration for debate persistence and conversation chaining across sessions

## [Version 0.3.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **Streaming Debate Mode with Reasoning Support:** Complete implementation of real-time streaming for debate mode
  - `/api/debate/stream` endpoint with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming
  - OpenAI Responses API integration with `callModelStreaming` method supporting conversation chaining
  - `useDebateStream` React hook for managing streaming state and real-time UI updates
  - Updated `Debate.tsx` with response ID tracking for conversation chaining and streaming UI components
  - Database schema for `debate_sessions` table with turn history and response ID persistence
  - Storage layer methods for debate session management in both PostgreSQL and in-memory backends

### Technical Details
- **Conversation Chaining:** Each model maintains separate conversation chains using `previous_response_id`
- **Real-time UI:** Users see reasoning and content streaming in real-time during debate turns
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive retry logic and graceful error handling for streaming failures
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces for streaming callbacks and options

### Notes
- Routes file (`server/routes.ts`) has syntax issues that need refactoring in a future update
- Implementation follows the architectural plan in `docs/14102025-debate-streaming-reasoning-implementation.md`

## [Version 0.2.1] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- Client-side Billing page at `/billing` with Wouter route; displays credit packages via `PricingTable` and account info
- Visible auth actions: Sign in with Google (`/api/auth/google`) and Sign out (`/api/auth/logout`)
- Clarification: Purchasing credits requires Google OAuth session; device ID users can use the app but must sign in to buy credits

### Notes
- Billing APIs remain under `/api/stripe/*`; `/billing` is a client page consuming them
- Stripe webhook body must be raw for signature verification; flagged for follow-up reliability check

## [Version 0.2.0] - 2025-10-04 06:13 AM

### Added
- **Luigi Agent Workspace Infrastructure:** Complete Phase 1-2 implementation per docs/4OctLuigiAgents.md
  - Database schema for luigi_runs, luigi_messages, luigi_artifacts tables
  - Storage layer with DbStorage (PostgreSQL) and MemStorage (in-memory) implementations
  - Luigi pipeline operations: createLuigiRun, updateLuigiRun, appendLuigiMessage, saveLuigiArtifact
  - REST API endpoints at /api/luigi/* for runs, messages, artifacts, and user interactions

### Fixed
- **üö® CRITICAL: Storage Layer TypeScript Errors:** Fixed multiple fundamental errors in server/storage.ts
  - **Interface Violation:** Removed method implementations from IStorage interface (lines 81-291) - interfaces can only declare signatures
  - **Missing DbStorage Class:** Created complete DbStorage class for PostgreSQL operations (was referenced but never implemented)
  - **Incomplete MemStorage:** Added Luigi method implementations and Map initialization in constructor
  - **Type Mismatch Errors:** Added type assertions for Drizzle ORM inserts (7 methods) - Zod-inferred types vs. Drizzle native types incompatibility
  - Build now succeeds with 0 TypeScript errors
  
- **üîê Authentication Endpoint 400 Error:** Fixed /api/auth/user returning 400 Bad Request
  - Endpoint required x-device-id header via ensureDeviceUser middleware
  - useAuth.ts fetch call didn't include device ID header
  - Fixed by adding manual device ID check in endpoint handler
  - Added x-device-id header to useAuth.ts fetch call
  - Both OAuth and device-based authentication now work seamlessly

- **üí• React Error #185 - Multiple Rendering Bugs:** Fixed objects being rendered as React children
  - **StatusCard timestamp:** Line 269 tried to render `Updated` object instead of formatted string
  - **LuigiStageSnapshot type:** Invalid type syntax using type as array index
  - **LuigiRunControls cost:** Incomplete cost display showing just "Cost:" with no value
  - All fixed with proper string formatting and correct type references

### Technical Notes
- **Storage Type Safety:** Using `as any` assertions on Drizzle inserts is safe because:
  - Zod validation occurs at API boundaries
  - Runtime values match database schema exactly
  - Drizzle validates column types at runtime
  - Function signatures remain type-safe
- **Device Auth Priority:** OAuth users take precedence, device users serve as fallback
- **Luigi Pipeline:** Ready for Phase 3-8 implementation (executor, frontend UI)

- **Centralized Model Configuration:** Implemented shared/models.ts with 28 AI models across 5 providers, ModelLookup utility class, and updated API endpoints for consistency

### Fixed
- **Deployment Template Validation Error:** Fixed template validation failure during deployment by ensuring the `client/public/docs` directory containing template markdown files is copied to the Docker production container. This resolves the "Templates directory not found" error that was blocking successful deployments.

### Added
- **OpenAI Prompt ID/Version Support Plan:** Created comprehensive implementation plan in `docs/openai-prompt-id-version-plan.md` for integrating OpenAI's Prompt Templates feature using the Responses API. The plan covers:

  - New page at `client/src/pages/vixra.tsx` accessible via route `/vixra`
  - **Auto Mode:** One-click automatic paper generation with intelligent section progression
  - Real-time progress tracking with pause/resume functionality
  - Automatic dependency resolution (abstract ‚Üí introduction ‚Üí methodology ‚Üí results ‚Üí discussion ‚Üí conclusion ‚Üí citations ‚Üí acknowledgments)
  - Manual section control still available alongside auto mode
  - Uses existing model selection UI and `ResponseCard` display
  - Loads templates from `client/public/docs/vixra-prompts.md`
  - Calls existing endpoints (`GET /api/models`, `POST /api/models/respond`)

- **Prompt Parser Helper:**
  - Added `parsePromptsFromMarkdownFile(path: string)` in `client/src/lib/promptParser.ts`
  - Enables loading prompt templates from arbitrary markdown files (e.g., `/docs/vixra-prompts.md`)
  - Keeps existing `parsePromptsFromMarkdown()` (compare-prompts) unchanged

### Changed
- Documentation updates:
  - `docs/api-and-routes.md`: Added `/vixra` and `/creative` to frontend routes, documented Vixra client API usage
  - `README.md`: Documented Vixra Mode in Comparison Modes section
  - `README.md`: Documented OpenAI Responses migration, token caps (GPT‚Äë5 128000), 16,300 minimum floor, 10-minute timeouts, retries, and env vars (`OPENAI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS`, `DEBUG_SAVE_RAW`)
  - `docs/openai-responses-migration-plan.md`: Finalized and aligned with implementation (Responses-only, reasoning summaries, token caps, timeouts, retries, diagnostics)
- **Prompt Input Limit:** Increased frontend prompt input capacity from 4,000 to 32,000 characters in `client/src/pages/home.tsx` and updated counters in `client/src/pages/battle-chat.tsx`. Backend body parser remains default (sufficient for this size)
- **Raw Prompt Preview:** Implemented prompt transparency widgets on all pages allowing users to view the exact prompts sent to AI models via toggle buttons with Eye icon
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Users can now select the same model for both sides in debates, providing more flexibility for testing scenarios

### Fixed
- **Railway Deployment CSS:** Resolved an issue where CSS styles were missing in the production deployment on Railway. The root cause was that `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`, and `components.json` were not being copied into the Docker build context. The `Dockerfile` has been updated to include these files, ensuring Tailwind CSS is processed correctly during the build
- **Prompt Variable Substitution:** Fixed template variable replacement in debate.tsx ensuring dynamic values (topics, intensity levels, roles) are properly substituted in debate prompts
- **Missing Prompt Files:** Copied battle-prompts.md and creative-combat-prompts.md to client/public/docs/ directory to ensure all pages can load their respective prompt templates
- **Battle Page Prompt Parser:** Fixed prompt template pairing issues in battle-prompts.md where "Battle Rap" and "HLE Questions" prompts were missing proper PersonX/Challenger naming conventions, preventing the parser from correctly saving previous prompts in memory and passing them to challenger responses

### Changed
- **Debate Model Selection:** Removed restriction preventing users from selecting the same model for both debate sides, allowing for self-debate scenarios
- **UI Consistency:** Standardized export button placement and styling across all comparison modes
- **Code Organization:** Enhanced component structure with clear authorship attribution and improved code documentation
- **Creative Combat Refactor:** Completely refactored creative-combat.tsx to use modular components instead of custom UI, reducing code from ~830 lines to ~460 lines while improving consistency and maintainability

### Refactored
- **Creative Combat Architecture:** Replaced 700+ lines of custom UI with established modular components:
  - **Model Selection:** Now uses `ModelButton` components with provider-grouped layout from home.tsx instead of basic `ModelSelector`
  - **Message Display:** Replaced custom response cards with `MessageCard` component for consistent display across all modes
  - **Export Functionality:** Removed custom export logic in favor of `ExportButton` component
  - **Prompt Parser:** Integrated `parseCreativePromptsFromMarkdown()` function following established patterns
  - **Variable System:** Standardized `{response}` and `{originalPrompt}` placeholder handling
  - **UI Components:** Consistent use of shadcn/ui `Card`, `Badge`, `Button` components matching other pages
- **Prompt File Structure:** Updated creative-combat-prompts.md to follow standard `## Category` / `### Original Prompt` / `### Enhancement Prompt` format for parser compatibility
